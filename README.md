Read the full guide on my [blog](https://josuevalrob.com/freelancer-startbootstrap-wordpress).

For installation you can donwload all the project and give it a new database, there are not main configuration in the database. So create a new one. 

There are some content, for post and page (about us) read about it in the [blog](https://josuevalrob.com/freelancer-startbootstrap-wordpress).

Also, you can just copy the theme on your wordpress site. 

Good luck!
